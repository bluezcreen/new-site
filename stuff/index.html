        "Honestly, I barely played this version. It was clunky, annoying to play, and has excessive encounter rates. I dropped the game right before Duncan Factory. Although I think the story seems interesting."<br><br>
        <h2>Mother 2, aka Earthbound</h2><br>
        "The most popular of the three. I fairly enjoyed it. It has a lot more gameplay than the story, but I think it's balanced enough. Loved it."<br><br>
        <h2>Mother 3</h2><br>
        "Oh boy, the game was so good it was never localized. Nintendo of Japan really gatekept the game. This game is possibly the GREATEST JRPG I've played so far. The combo attack mechanic is very mesmerizing, the story is very in-depth this time, and the ending is peak. Although I wish we got more of the unused content."
