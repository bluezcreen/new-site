      <section class="wcontent">03.12.25 //<br><br>It has not even been a month since the first lines for this site was written and of course, it needs a due rework already. All of the repetitive code blocks (like the window panels like this you're seeing that contain these paragraphs) bloat up the .html file and makes debugging infuriating. And everything about the layout is messy too.<br><br>
      I'm currently trying to figure out how to make a custom component for it and so far it's a bit annoying. But it most likely get worse because I have to remake all of my pages with new and optimized code. I literally set myself up for damnation for lacking an intellectual prowess in markup.<br><br>
      I also had ideas to write all the elements from scratch because I feel guilty having most of my site be made by AI (read below) but that will be EVEN MORE of a pain in the ass. Though I might be up for it. I yearn for optimization.<br><br>
      Also, Merry Christmas I guess.</section>
